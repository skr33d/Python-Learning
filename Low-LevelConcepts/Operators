Order of Operations

Highest Priority operators are unary; meaning they take one argument
 1. ~ - +     Tilde is the bitwise equivalent of "not", negative, or logical negation. It inverts bits.
 2. **        Exponentation is right-associative, or has a right-sided binding. Meaning it operates from right to left.
 3. * / // %  Arithmetic operators are higher priority than logical.
 4. - +
 5. >> <<     Digraphs are bitwise equivalents of multiplication(<< shifts left) and floor division(>> shifts right)
 6. <= < > >= Logical operators are higher priority than compound.
 7. == != 
 8. &         Ampersand is bitwise equivalent of "and", or logical conjunction. 
 9. ^         Caret is bitwise XOR. "Exclusive or" 
10. |         Bar is bitwise equivalent of "or", or logical disjunction.
11. = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= >>= <<=
