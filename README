This repository is a collection of scripts I've written while learning Python.

*Note to self* Commit messages only apply to specific file when recordable change is made to code. 
i.e. Deleting empty bottom line in order to commit a change will record the message, but only for the repository description. 
Deleting empty line within body of the code will record commit message to specific file.
